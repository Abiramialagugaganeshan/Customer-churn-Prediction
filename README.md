# Customer-churn-Prediction
**About the Project**

This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. Customer churn refers to the loss of clients or customers. By predicting churn, businesses can take proactive steps to retain customers and reduce turnover.

**Get Started**

The project involves several stages including data preprocessing, feature aggregation, model building, and deployment. This documentation will guide through the necessary steps to successfully run and deploy the churn prediction model.

# Core Features

**Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, categorical variable encoding, and scaling.
**Feature Aggregation:** Aggregates features to create meaningful inputs for the model.
**Model Building:** Utilizes XGBoost for high performance and accuracy in predictions.

**Real-Time Predictions:** Supports real-time predictions through a web interface.

**Deployment:** Easy deployment using Flask and Django frameworks.

# How to Use

**Preprocess Data**: Run the data preprocessing script to clean and prepare the dataset.

**Train Model**: Execute the training script to build the model.

**Make Predictions**: Use the provided interface to make predictions on new data.

# About the Model
The model used in this project is XGBoost, a powerful and efficient implementation of the gradient boosting framework. XGBoost is chosen for its speed and performance, especially with large datasets. It provides high accuracy and handles missing data effectively.
